"Horrible noise coming while washing or spinning. Returned back.However, Samsung customer care was not convinced by my complaint of horrible noise and rejected my request to return the product. Thereafter, i raised my issue with Amazon and they have understood my grievance and sent their own technician. The technician have checked the machine thoroughly and come to conclusion that it was some manufacturing defect due to which annoying noise was coming. And next day amazon arranged for pickup of the product and after 2- 3 hours of pickup money was transferred to my bank account. I am very much impressed by such a world class customer grievance redressal system.Thanks alot Amazon Team. Happy to have such great services.",1
"It's made my life easier.Writing this review after 1 month of use.1. Can wash everything from socks to curtains and sofa covers,rugs, bedsheets and everything comes out clean and dry.2. Just put the clothes, fill liquid detergent and I complete all my housework while clothes are getting washed automatically.3. There is soaking option also so in 75 minutes cycle all my clothes are soaked, washed, rinsed and dried. Makes life comfortable.4. Even if electricity goes it doesn't matter as it starts from the same point when it was stopped.5. Sometimes it happens I started the machineand come to my room and found a pair of socks that I  forget to put..no problem..I just switch off the machine, open the lid and and put the socks inside and switch on the main switch again. No reprogramming required.6. Only 1 thing sometimes the lint of other clothes gets deposited on woollens or jackets. So it's better to wash woollen clothes separately from daily wear. But it can be dusted off easily with a cloth brush after drying.7. And most important the machine self cleans itself.8. I purchased a long drain pipe separately as the drain pipe was too small. Now drain water is spilled out directly near the drain hole and my bathroom remains dry and clean.9. Saves time, your hands and feet are soft as you don't need to put them in soap and water everyday for washing clothes. In one month my feet have become soft and pink.",5

 Washing machine got delivered on 4th dec'20 and using it for the first time on 9th dec'20 and it produce enormous noise like a machine gun during washing but it's normal during spin. It's clearly shows I have received defective product. I am really disappointed with technician who came for demo because he didn't checked washing and spin condition during his visit. But now when I called him he asks to raise a complaint on the product. I know this is a good model and brand and I have received defective one and I demand 100% replacement. Check the video as a customer I'm very disappointed and not happy with the product. Delivery was really perfect and neat even during rainy days but got the defective product which need to be replaced immediately. Need Amazon to prioritise and replace this product at the earliest.",5

 Defective product recieved..the technician came and checked and told that the inner drum was broken...so rapid vibrations were there...both samsung and amazon denied to return the product at first...I must say worst ever customer service by Samsung...the technician came to install the product and declared it as a defective/damaged product amd left without providing any jobsheet or service denial reason or number. I repeatedly called samsung but they denied to provide jobsheet and service denial request number as proof...and amazon kept on denying the return due to lack of jobsheet. So finally after so much of explanation and hassle, amazon decided to return and provide refund. But, this time they refunded a lesser amount. During kick-off of festival season sale for prime members, we were supposed to get 1750 rs instant bank discount, 1250 rs amazon pay cashback and 750 rs cashback by Cloudtail for this peoduct. I can understand during returning this product, they can deduct the bank diacount and cashback by seller but they shouldn't deduct the cashback of 1250 rs also....because I got the 1250 rs cashback as a result of ordering 3 items ar a time with total cart value of 30000. I should have been provided a cashback of proportionate to 13490 (actual price of this washing machine). Being a prime member and a regular customer, I feel disappointed with the service by amazon",2
"Overall product is average not recommended.. better to check and purchase from local shop.I am using Samsung 6.2 kg Diamond Drum model from last 10 year without any issue hence ordered same. Compare to that this machine is low in quality, Drum size almost half size seems 5kg model, panel button poor quality .. no difference in water level from 1 to 4, it fills water up to full. Warranty card and manual are photo copy.. I doubt about the genuinity.. I think it is duplicate production.",1
Worst service provided by Samsung... No one caring for installation... No warranty accepted. Don't go for Samsung.. as we have many other super quality brands.... I have been waiting for installation from past 45 days... No calls. No follow ups... This pandemic is not the reason behind delay... It's all about worst management... And follow ups...,1
"* No installation charges* machine takes 25-35 mins for one wash depending type selected.* bought it for Rs 11500/- after cashback and discounts, so considering the price feel like gr8 deal* Overall very happy with the purchase* Can clean 8-10 garments(typically 700g jeans/300g shirt) in one wash easily so ideal for 3-4 ppl.Some cons : * Machine takes a little more amount of water and detergent  than semi automatic . * Require cleaning of tub after 8-10 washes* Although the packaging box for the machine is not protected by any foam/thermocol sheet on the sides,Machine was in good condition ..delivered without any dents.(would suggest u have a look before u accept delivery)",1
"In the products details, Amazon has clearly written that the products carries 2 years comprehensive warranty while the motor carries 10 years warranty. The same was confirmed by their customer care in a call. However after purchase, when we contacted samsung , they made it clear that they offer only 2 years warranty on motor, and in case of any otherwise claim, only seller is responsible. So beware of this contradiction before purchase.",4
The first machine was damaged had to return it. Amazon took its own time to replace it with another one and the installation turnaround time was very bad. The second machine also started giving trouble within 10 days and I am now following up with Samsung to repair the machine or replace it again. Bad experience on my first time washing machine purchase from Amazon.,3
"This top-loading washing machine is really easy to use. I bought it for my mother, who is used to a semi-automatic WM. I found that she is able to adapt and use it with ease.  It takes a little more water compared to front-loading machines, but almost the same or maybe less than semi-automatic WM.The overall washing perfomance is great.I ordered the machine at 4PM, it got delivered the next morning at 8AM, at Durgapur (WB), I booked the free installation by calling the Samsung customer care. The engineer visited at 11AM, same day, and the machine was ready to use soon. I purchased a stand to keep the machine. I am really happy with the extremely prompt service of Amazon and Samsung customer support.This is a great machine, blindly go for it.",5
We got this in the month of May '2021 initially I was skeptical about it but it is really nice the monsoon option is a.feature which really helps the clothes get almost dried which very helpful they had this facility extendedable pipe for atleast 10cm which was great as we could deattach and reattach whenevr it is necessary. Service installation as well is good he offered us a cover and a really good stand it was little costly but the stand was worth which is movable and adjustable. He gave the machine cleaner as well to clean the entire machine and keep it in good condition. When u compare with front load this doesn't give my much sound which is really good. Over Al it was an affordable and more options washing machine.,5
"I installed the machine myself from start to finish , the engineer came,  gave a 50 second demo and when I asked him to go slow and explain one  of the functions I was charged for installation lol ludicrous service at its best 😂 Never buying anything from samsung again.",1
"My old washing Machine was Samsung too which still works fine despite more than 12 years of usage. This one is Value for Money. Easy to operate, nothing much has changed in the operations or interface in several years!One thing I notice is that it appears that there’s no way to clear the previous memory, just in case. All you need to do is hit Cycle button and previous options are cleared, if they are still present despite you pressed Power Button previously. This point comes up only has a habit from my previous model usage, which would clear the memory after pressing Power Button.Monsoon 15 or 30 mIn spin cycle options is still present and useful, though not that great. Nothing exceptional, but Value for money and suitable for small family on relatively tight budget.",4
"First product received was damaged had easily recognisable dent on the front side, while the box looked absolutely fine, the second replacement product received had a minor dent again on front side not visible by naked eyes until you see from side angle and scratch on left side at the bottom. I gifted this machine to my mother, but now we tired of having it replaced again and again, it is good to buy electronic items from Croma, we have had amazing experience till now. We would think more than 100 times now before ordering from Amazon atleast big electronic appliances. I really don't know who to reach out whether Amazon, Retailer / Dealer or Samsung?",2

 It's not working.. I'm trying to return the product options are not available..",2
"Dear Team,Needs your support here, as discussed earlier i spoke with Samsung team and there executive visited 5 times but no resolution so far. so please now replace my washing machine from your end. because samsung team has took approx one and half month for replying back. and they  denying to replace this product. an provide your correct communication details.",1
"Product is decent for the price. But that's not alone what determines the quality. After a week since delivery, they didn't send anyone for installation and I had to do it myself. After making numerous calls and complaint requests, I was assured multiple times an engineer would come but never came. I've always been wary of Samsung products but this was the last straw. From now on I will try to avoid buying any Samsung product unless there's no better alternative. I will keep a 3 star for now until I see prolonged usage of this product. I absolutely don't recommend buying Samsung.",1
Perfectly working..,3
I am writing this review after a week or so of usage. some pros and consSamsung is a great brand and has been improving all the timeSuper quick delivery and installation ( just had to remind Cust Care to get it done !)Ease of Use and similar to the old Samsung 6.2 kgsQuick wash and uses lesser water than the older Samsung 6.2 KgsExchange offer of Rs 1800 ! through Amazon / dealer provides only Rs 500 ! Exchange offerAwesome product for the money paid !!!ConsSamsung 6.2 kgs bought about 10 years back is bigger than the present 6.5 kgs !Slightly shakes when the clothes are less which i believe is normal for any washing MachineHence the rating of 4 star !,5
I bought this model and found that there is serious bug which the manufacturer needs to look into and have to fix. This machine will not drain the last used water for rinse if you select the function Wash+Rinse or Rinse only. The water used for the last rinse will remain in the tub and it cannot be drained. For to whom the mentioned is not clear I will explain my experience. I turned on the machine and manually selected Wash and Rinse function and skipped Spin because I preferred to get the clothes dried on direct sunlight. The cycle selected in Soak+Normal. The machine started washing then moved to the next stage which is rinsing. The whole process got completed in an hour and machine automatically turned off but the water used for last rinse still remains in the tub. There is no way to drain the last used water. In short if you do not opt for Spin function then the last intake water will remain in the wash tub even after completion of whole process. Is there any fix for this?,1

 Started making noise from the 11th day of delivery.. Called Installation person, No response... Called Customer care, heard only flute music for 45 minutes.. Logged 2 tickets, Samsung closing the tickets automatically saying, check for coins in pockets of dresses which is washing inside the machine... Worst Customer Service.. If you really want to get yourself busy with samsung customer care, buy this product..",1
Delivery persons were too CARELESS and in hurry. They firstly fell shoe racks and scattered all shoes at outside of my gate. They treat my old machine(which was exchanged) mercilessly with fearful noise also scattering water to my floor by not giving sufficient time to extract the water from outlet pipe and felling outlet hose.  After their return I have a lot of mess to clean. Putting all the shoes/mopping a large floor area etc.,4
"This is the most pathetic website, never buy any appliances from this website, they don;t even contact to brand neither they will schedule your appointment for installation. Better to buy product from local dealer for same day installations. This pathetic website even after 1 month they will not install the product.",1
"The exchange did not work as it was stated. Policy said washing machine should be in working condition. But upon delivery of new product they refused to accept old product saying it was making noise. Felt cheated, but it was too late. Had difficulty in accommodating 2 machines at home until the time I got someone else to take it away.If you are planning an exchange, better not to go for online purchase, else you are at the mercy of the person who comes to collect it.The installation happened over a week after the product delivery and several reminder calls had to be madeMachine now works well.",1
"I am just satisfied with this product. But I wouldn't call this is the best product. Its not energy efficient. Its only a 3 star rated energy efficient product. Wouldn't have bought if I had seen it during the purchase itself. Energy rating is not mentioned in the product description. It works fine. Not too many options in the board. Very few like normal and normal + soak, quick wash. Automatic water level picking. There is no aqua mode in this machine, where you can fill water and let the machine spin without taking by itself from the tap. Product got delivered as promised but service/installation was delayed by two weeks due to lockdown. My old machine was taken during the product delivery itself. So, we were left without an option but to fix the washing machine by ourselves. Another disappointment was that after I had bought it, the next day the price was dropped by 5%. Not so nice :)",3
"I brought the machine about 10 months ago and I have faced couple of issues but Samsung Care executives came home and checked the machine, apparently it was low pressure of water that was creating havoc.I sorted that out with a mini pump that provides a better flow of water to the machine.Quite satisfied with the response from Samsung. Would recommend to those on tight budget.Only cn",5
"Washing is such a mundane task for me. This washing machine makes it easy. Just a few clicks load your laundry and detergent and conditioner and forget about it. Come back after the exact time. Your laundry will be soaked, rinsed and spin. This is exactly what I needed since I was looking for a top load basic machine. It does exactly what they say. I installed it in my apartment by myself and it's an easy process.",5
"I had 2 lg washing machine but this time I thought of trying with Samsung. But Samsung machine is a big disappointment to be honest. First it consumes hell lot 9f water unnecessary, secondly time management is poor. It is not real time, eg. it shows 5 mins left in the display panel but checking after 5 mins it will show 4 more mins.I selected this over LG for saving rs. 2k but paying for it now. I wish I could have option to return it now.",2
The website says it's compatible for 5peple family but it is really not. It doesn't work properly when you add all the five people clothes and towels. Not filling water in the machine vastly(not any water supply problem). When I called cc to replace with a bigger machine with 7kg or more capacity. They are saying it's not refundable and you can't buy another product. Pathetic service Samsung and Amazon. I am ready to pay the amount for more capacity but they are denying .,1
"Though skeptical after reading customer feedbacks, I went for it coz my previous machine was samsung n it worked fine for 14 years n now there is some noise in it.I was worried when d installation rep carried it at a tilting position to place it near d electrical point. But it works well. Noise level is ok n it's easy to use too. Samsung rocks!👍Pleased with d fast delivery by Amazon -ordered on 22 Apr, rec'd 24th morning. Unbelievable but true!",5
"Physical fitness and quality is good, Delivery also Good, But i give one star because of programming cycle,rotar rotation time for one direction is very less in 1st wash so that upper side cloth got only minor jerk (rotation).  some time upper clothes does not move😏, in 2nd wash rotor on side rotate time is less then 1st wash so clothes not clean and detergent remain in cloths😳,so after and complete wash, powder(detergent) remain in clothes.Also dryer not work perfectly.I am totally un happy with this because of its programming cycle, There are no meaning to buy fully automatic machine🙄.",1
"Washing machine is good, doing the job perfectly.Very much dissappointed with the installation service.After 10 days also, they did not come to install and contact number provided by them for installation is either busy, switch off or not responding.At last i had to install myself with the help of friends.Please don't buy if you can't install by yourself. But also they will say not to install yourself due to warrantypurposes.Negative star for installation services.",1
This is cheapest fully automatic machine from Samsung. But it does not have a basic feature of heavy wash cycle. So in all cycles the clothes are delicately washed. Secondly it does not memorize the current washing cycle if the electricity goes. You have to start all over again if there is no electricity.,2
"I had a samsung washing machine in the past, used it for almost 10 years towards the end replaced pcb and other parts when I decided to exchange it for this particular model.Everything about is good except that the lint in this particular model for some reason does not get caught in the trap. I called samsung customer care, the technician came and simply replace the filter charging me 400/- despite it being under warranty. No luck with the new part.The piece is defective is all I can say and samsung does not want to replace it.Really samsung this is unexceptable when you pay so much just to see that its not doing its job.I hope they read this and send a replacement.",2
"Very easy to use and silent operation. You can wash, rinse and spin clothes separately as well. Detects the water level automatically. Has quickwash and energy saving cycle options as well. You can use these options when washing less soiled clothes. Looks great and the installation was done on very next day of the delivery. I bought it for Rs 12,600 with SBI card offer, during Republic Day Sale.",1
1. Water inlet pipe is very small -1 mtr2. Main wire is also very small - 1.5mtrBoth I had to replace  & spend Rs.1200 extra. 3. After 3 months use I find lint prints on cloths after every washThis is my 3rd Samsung w/m I never faced such problems wid 2 earlier machines.  I'm not happy.I'll not buy Samsung products now.,5
"Ordered this machine but was initially sceptic coz of prior reviews. First one delivered on time and installation person too came on time but found some fault with the machine and asked me to replace it. So as per his request placed replacement order and got new one again on time and this time machine was in good condition. Hats off to Samsung Technician, very polite and very professional. He ddnt try to sell me anything. Installed the machine and explained each and every detail about it. Been using it for couple of days now and most interesting part to me is very very less noise levels. You literally have to stand next to the machine to hear sound. Extremely satisfied!!",5
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Very easy to use and looks great. It's not noisy or shaky if you place it in a flat surface. I was a bit doubtful after reading the reviews but I'm glad I went with my gut feeling. Clothes come out clean and fresh and the guy who had come for the demo was very helpful. Thanks for making life easy🙂🙏",3
"This model of Samsung washing machine is a great product for families up to 4-6 people. It's very affordable, and the size is compact. The options are just enough for us to handle anything and everything we can imagine. The monsoon function is exceptionally useful and dried clothes very well. Clothes DO NOT entangle which is great too. Just start and forget. We are yet to use the delay feature, but it's a great option too. Delicate mode makes life easier.Overall , it's a great product, backed by Samsung's service. We are very happy with it.",5
"Very good product. Easy to use fully automatic. Noise level not that high, you need to adjust its base so that its in level and will not vibrate much. Little bit expensive. Also drain hole is in lowest side of machine and without any pumping motor. So you need to keep drain pipe lower than that. Overall its good purchase and value for money.",4
"WM is good, not best. Samsung is definitely good brand. Machine quality is great. The sides are stainless steel but are thin sheets.It’s a little complicated in beginning to understand. But then it’s very simple. Looks are very beautiful.Not good partsThe machine drum spins less. It doesn’t spins for a whole round or two and changes direction. It feels like it’s week but it is not. But I think if it spins full it will be more powerful and effective.Good buy and should go for it",4
"We had a BPL washing machine for more than 20 years from the early 2000s! And I wanted to gift my parents a washing machine with my own money before shifting out of their house. I ordered and got it installed, the machine works very well and the drying ability is great. Thinner fabrics like bedsheets or tshirts get dried so well it's ready to use almost immediately after coming out of the machine. The other clothes might require just an hour of drying outside.",5
The machine makes noise while spinning .it's brand new and purchased on 30 April 2021.customer support is not responding and no support received until. please think before you make a choice.It has been more than 3 months no resolution please do not pick this model,1
First automatic washing machine in home. Quite easy to operate. As per user it consume bit more water as compare to semiautomatic.Used only one time currently.Overall nice experience while use.Will share experience after sometime of usage .,4
"Worst experience, received the product with broken suspension rod just shoved in the drum by seller. Spent 750 INR just to get it repaired instead of returning since it was meant as a Diwali gift and didnt wanted to spend so much time in process",1
Pathetic service.Received a damaged product and there is so much delay in returning the product.Installation engineer has certfied that product is defective even then Amazon is not accepting and making another technician visit after one week's time.Customer is trapped,1
"Honest review after couple of full cycle wash.The washing machine is definately a value for money with trust of samsung after sales network. There is no issue with the delivery and it was hassle free installation within a day of delivery.There is no big noise whenever you machine operates. Some chim sound to notify you that buttons are being pressed, on/off and once it completes whole cycle it did the chim sound again. Overall nice operation and good amount of washing.The machine dont have soft closing lid feature, and samsung guy told me that this particular machine didn't come with 10 years motor warranty. The 10 years warranty is for wobble technology one.But yes, 2 years warranty for the machine is there which will get enabled automatically after the delivery.Most importantly this machine dont have return facility but one can replace it with same machine again if there are some technical or physical flaws.",1
"I am giving three star because1.Energy star rating is three2.memory backup is not available for power outage.3.Inlet pipe provide with machine is very small only one metre, it must be at least two meter.4. Packing was damaged before delivery.All other things are ok you can go for it if energy cost is not an essue for you.",3
I have alreday used Whirpool Top Load Machine since 2018.But this machine is truly amazing.Wash clothes like pro with no hassle.Programs are very easy to use and system is cool.Most importantly it's used very less water and electricity.Just loved this.I recommend to my sister and she bought and after using 7 days she also loved this.Thank you Samsung and Amazon bring this machine with a worthy deal.,3
When we buy from a brand like samsung the expectation is superior customer care. The reality is they treat customer like trash. Installation not done after 3 days. Agent closed ticket stating I am not available at home while I was there 24x7. Calls to customer care take forever to connect. What app and live chat don't work.,1
"The mchine works fine. but Cleaning at times is not good enough inspite of proper soap and conditioner. We may need to run the load twice in a while inspite of cleaning the Filters. Got it a great price, so I guess, it's a compromise. Not recommended if you have issues with Water shortage, or timings for water release.",3
"This is just an economic product, so many options but not a justified distinguished support, all auto support but not much on use. And loads of water is waster and electricity... Only cool thing is - keep clothers detergent and full support of water will return washed and semi soaked clothers after 50 minutes.",3
"This is the 3rd washing machine of this brand (Samsung) and model (WA65A4002VS/TL) that I have purchased. The machine is noiseless, easy-to-use and one of the bestsellers on all major online marketplaces. Samsung installation service is excellent, but please make sure the tap you're planning to connect to this machine has sufficient water pressure (and fix it beforehand, if not). It has 5 wash modes, but the 'Quick Wash' and 'Soak + Normal' modes are the ones you're most likely to use for day-to-day laundry. Highly recommended.",5
"Hello ,I have been using this washing machine for around 3 months now.Pros:1. Clothes get cleaned satisfactorily2. Almost noiseless3. Very efficient and fast4. Looks cute5. All the essential functions are there including the powerful Monsoon dry function.Cons:1. None so farIf you are looking for a budget washing machine for 2-3 people, go blindly for it. There aren't many awesome machines at this range.Until next timeRupam",5
"This is a tried and tested washing machine that we have been using. Had the same machine at my home town as well.For people who are looking for a washing machine and are confused, this is the best option that you can go for. The pricing is very economical and the functionioning is very good.Quiet easy to use and operate.Noise levels are very minimal and is a Value for money product.This is 6.5kgs and is sufficient for a family of 3-4 people.The demo guy came on time the next day.Would definitely recommend this product to everyone whoz confused on which washing machine to buy.Energy consumption: 5/5Looks: 5/5Functions: 5/5Noise level: 4/5Washing: 5/5",5
"Don't go for this product. The price looks alluring but its body is fragile like a flower petal. My second replacement too was in a badly damaged state. Dents all around, unstable body .. it was tilting to one side. Foot rest was broken. The first delivery was literally dumped, two boys just dropped it. Carried the product horizontally and not vertically. The worst part is the delivery service by Ms Aruna  Warehousing Company. I hav seen the delivery boys in action. They never follow the doorstep delivery protocol. On the second time, the machine was carried like a sack by a delivery boy.",5
It doesn't work.suspension rod is displaced. Even the Samsung guy who came for installation couldn't install the machine. Still waiting for replacement related communication from Amazon team.,1
"After 2 week of usage my honest review-One must remember that it has no memory, that means if power goes off then it will not be continuing from the same moment where it was obstructed. Although it will restart in that particular stage from beginnings.Rat mesh quality is poor. It was already cracked when i opened the tub. It is very thin. Drainage pipe is very short. Although you can extend it by installing another pipe from market.Delivery was on time. Product was Nicely packed.Machine is durable and washing is up to the mark. It is gentle on clothes, It also has a delicate mode which washes soft clothes perfectly.Overall I am satisfied with this product at this price range.On can go for this for a family of 4-5.",1
"You cant reach out to samsung or amazon for the installation etc. There is no option for that. I tried amazon support but no option is available for installation support.Only they will contact you when they feel like.You can't reach out to them.Its been 15 days and the installation is not done by their team nor the warranty related stamping.I bought this cause I was in hurry and now i regret. I have installed it by a plumber who has charged INR 1,500/-. Had i known about it i would have hired him before or ordered it from Croma.Dont by Samsung product from amazon.And please add some contact number or support person for installation followups.ThanxPlease add",1
Very good machine. Purchased it during the Republic Day sale and got a steal deal by exchanging my semi automatic 6.5 kg LG washing machine and got 2440/- exchange value. The machine is really easy to use simple and at the same time effective. The best machine in this price range.,5
"Value for money.Used it for almost 2.5 months now.It had been a good experience.This has all those hidden features which you come across a 15k below machine.Only thing is they have forgotten to highlight some features. ;)Ordered for a normal machine and got a 3* rated machine. Thanks amazon and Samsung.Main pros are -No much difference in E Bill.Noise levels are lowInstallation process was hassle free. ( we live in Hyderabad though.)Really helpful for a working and non working class people.Overall, decent product at decent price.Expect less and you get more🎉",5
"Order this product in a slight Hesitation but was amazed by its performance at a very reasonable price. I am writing this review after 2weeks of usage, its Simply superb.",5
As soon as we start the washing machine it starts spinning a few times without water. Then the water starts flowing into the washing machine. Sometimes the time shows 47 mins and sometimes it shows 40 mins.,1
"Like :Easy to Use: just put the cloth inside the machine and press sart button.Less Water Consumption : in-built feature of loading water automatically as per the clothes, the washing machine decides an adequate amount of water required for the wash.Size : compair to semi automatic machine it's take less space.Effective Cleaning : not required Scrub the clothes before putting into the washing machine.Dislike :Alert / buzzer : buzzer sound is lowElectricity Consumption : it take more electricity compare to semi automatic machine, a single run take 45 min.",5
"I bought this Samsung washing machine 6.5 kg which was delivered to us within 5 days and installation was done very next day. So didn't find any difficulties or hassle here.Now it's been more than 10 days i am using it, I really don't find any problem which people has mention in previous review for this product. I also saw many comments for noise level, trust me guyz it's not noisy at all. Washing quality is very good.Over all I am satisfied with product and definitely recommend to everyone in this budget. Don't see any other comment and don't get confuse guyz, ""just go for it"".Thank you Amazon and thank you Samsung for your services. I am happy to become your customer.",5
Recieved two time’s damaged product ..not sure what safety measures will take while trapsortation.. cloudtail seller is selling all damaged products to costumers ..But amazon and samsung  also responsible for this..and motor warranty 10 years mentioned but they have given only for four years ..for machine it’s 2 years..nothing is good with this product go for other one all fake data..and move to flipkart,5
"Very Very Very bad service from Samsung & Amazon together they making customer suffer during service need, After 03 days of service request no response from Samsung & the seller Amazon asking today another 03 days.Request new purchaser please use flipkart /tata cl/Reliance digital or local store.",1
We exchanged a older LG to this one. Works well. No complaints after 2 weeks. Simple to operate so older folks can use - not too many buttons. Got it for a great deal from amazon with exchange. Unbelievable value for money. Delivery from Amazon was without hassle and damage free.,1
"Dents on the body, was really in need of it so didn't applied for replacement, working well, but wash quality is bad really bad,  normal mode, quick wash mode, and delicate mode, in every mode, tube turbine just slightly rotates the clothes, semi automatic machines washes clothes better than this turbine...",1

 Edited my review after good after sales assistance from samsung. Good working washing machine at an attractive price. Only negative side is the noise and absence of hard wash/jeans mode. Had ordered it for home while I was away. Reuturned to find out this! Called samsung care they are not much of use.Makes a lot of noise. Rather simpler modes and no jeans/hard wash mode.Overall, go for it if this is your first fully automatic washing machine.",4
Never purchase samsung products because of their poor repair and installation service. Returned product for not installing it and raised many complaints but no one came for installationSo. Stay away from samsung products,1
Worst samsung instalation service..They refused to install if no stand is purchsed from them... They compelled me to pay rs.1200 for the stand despite having my own stand. They failed to install inlet pipe properly. I have to do it on my own..,3
"Even though so many negative reviews I choose to buy this, which I regret now, the product is too noisy and makes too much noise as compared to my previous one even though this one is lot costlier, not even one month while the drum rotates at maximum speed or while it spins in anti clock wise it makes some weird noise, choose another product and save your money than buy this junk",1
Everything is good. But the washing machine doesn't have the option to increase the time. And doesn't have the option to use Strong wash. So the washing is normal is not very strong. The machine should give strong wash option as well so that if someone wants they can do the strong wash sometime as well.,4
"I'm going to keep this review short and simple. So we bought this washing machine around 1 month back and have had no problems so far, this thing takes workload like a beast and gets the job done in a jiffy. Kudos to amazon and the seller for delivering this in perfect condition!",4
"-at 14K, it appears cheap but not good at all-functions are easy, also not noisy-washing not good at all, my whites got ruined.-using 2 top load full automatic LGs at home, better go for that or if not on budget then go for front load",5
This product gets repairs frequently. You will get fed-up calling the customer care and technicians to fix the issues and they will not be fixed as the product itself is defective. Coming to the washing it does not clear the hard stains on clothes . It only washes smooth stains. If your clothes have more dirt or thick stains it will not clear the hard stains like whirlpool which I already have. Please do not buy and cry later,2
This is what your clothes will be after washing in this machine. Have been after Samsung however no resolution given and they say there is no issue with machine. Please never buy this product its total waste of money.,1
"Easy to use washing machine and the Samsung technician is very good, supportive and knowledgeable.However, the outer body is slightly damaged and the main root cause is the packaging from Samsung. Saving few bucks on appliance packaging is not only damaging the product but also the brand image of Samsung.",1
"please don't buy this product...wast of your money. they given fully automatic..but have bug is there. what i notice one when power cut, it wont start same progress. second during water taking noticed sound and vibration. finally water level changes during washing time not taken",1
Product was damaged and broked in the back even there was dent in the back side of machine. I was waited to get this product but finally resulted in to dissatisfaction. Refundin or replacing does not make situation good where customer have some thoughts attached to product and also manage there budget when they buy such products. This is worst Experience have been suffered. There is no compensation policy Amazon have when such things happen.👎,1
"The visiting service from samsung is very poor. Especially in Maharashtra region. To have a demo and installation, it was very difficulty task. This leads to a very huge setback to samsung company as we common people depend upon a relaiable and fast service from authorised service engineer, instead of local technician. In our region, particularly in पश्चिम महारष्ट्र western Maharashtra it is usually told that samsung service is not good you should buy goods from some other company. It should be stopped. And the dealership should be changed to someone else, atleast of Sangli and Kolhapur.",4
Previously i hv semi automatic washing machine it was so time consuming and very hard for use because all the time one need be there to wash and rinse and spin the clothes...but now it's very easy for me just to put dirty clothes and after few minutes your clothes r clean no need stay nad watch all the time this machine have very easy use functions as well as energy saving and perfect working woman...,5
Looking exchange offer for my old semi automatic washing machine &  I got this samsung fully automatic washing machine as a exchange offer.....superb & fast service customer care service also good ... overall overall good product....must buying 👍🏻👍🏻,5
"The product was delivered on time and installation was done within 48hrs. There was a minor fault during installation so the machine broke down, but amazon and samsung both were helpful regarding repairing the machine. The machine is running smoothly now. It is not at all noisy, the controls are fully automatic so very easy to use. One thing i noticed is that it uses less water compared to my old machine (whirlpool top load fully automatic 6.2kg), so this machine saves water too. I would suggest this machine considering its low price and high quality and service.",5
"This was such a waste of money for me.1. Amazon delivered a faulty product to me. One of the tub suspender was in the cardboard container it came in. It should be inside the machine, not in the container.2. After the repair, it now keeps on washing the clothes. The timer does not change, the water supply does not cut off automatically. It's a total mess.I am not into writing bad reviews but this is a very bad product. The service was fine though.",5
"Don't let its size fool you. Excellent build quality, super finish and simply put it gets the job done. Budget friendly and compact to store. Love the look of it.Thanks Amazon!",1
"Like: all features, this is a replacement after 15 years of the same type of Samsung top loader.Dislike: the cheater installation guy who took Rs 2000 for a cover and stand without giving a receipt and disappeared.",1
Its good but only problem is when it starts to spins then it make some initial noise of banging to the body but once it pick of the speed then it gets normal. Value for money and very good if you buying washing machine for first time. If its your second time purchase i would suggest to go with front load.,5
"Dear Team,This is not Expected from our side your product information  rating score showing  is 4.5 Amazon side ..and Actul product delivery 3 star what happened??As on date not responding for installation and demo work from samsung team side ...kindly Collecte my product and refund my money",1
The washing machine is super helpful. It's a great value for money at this price. Only downside is it fills water to its brim for both washing and rinsing irrespective if the clothes are less or more. So water is wasted . Apart from that rest everything is awesome,1
It's a great product especially for the price tag. I had just one complaint regarding the front panel buttons. They are a bit cheap (quality wise). After a month I was a bit worried that they might stop working on pressing but it hasn't happened yet. But they definitely need a little bit of improvement. Rest everything is amazing including the service. The service guy arrived just one day after the delivery.,5
I bought this recently for my grandparents. Since she was struggling with back pain. She loved it and said its very easy to use. Then i bought the same for my parents and in-laws also. All of them say in unison that they love this product regardless of the previous one since the options provided are practical and no much complicated process. The water and electricity consumption has reasonably reduced since we replaced our old one to this.,5
"Does the job well, compared to our previous LG washing machine this makes little bit more noise.Delivery was done as per the committed date and time.LG technician also make later within 6 hrs. to install and demo the machine.The service has been very professional.It has been less than 2 weeks, and hence cannot tell much for about the functioning of the machine and the product.",4
9 days back I got the product and noone ever come up for installation after 2 3 times calling to customer care. If this is the way of valuing customer I have a huge question for myself of I would like to buy again.,5
It's a very worthful product when compared with other companies. It's very easy to use. Brand installation is successfully completed and their demo can be understood in a easy way.When coming to washing machine it is very useful product and low noise emitting.,5
Best you can buy.. I literally love using it.  I would recommend to all that yes you all can go ahead & bou this washing machine.. It's just bestest you can ever get. I really loved it. You can wash blankets too upto 6.5 kg as the machine is of 6.5 right & if machine is 8kg you can put clothes till 8kg ..So as of now this machine is of 6.5 kg so you can wash upto 6.5 kg blanket ..n if u are washing 6.5 kg blanket then you should wash one at a time... You can even wash net clothes/sarees in delicate wash .,1
Pathetic installation service. The water was leaking for 3 days. There was no response from customer service . Samsung services are a hassle and i strictly don't recommend buying their products.,5
It's been 48hours and no one has come for installation. The machine is just kept in the house. The engineer is not picking up the phone and the customer care is just giving excuses . Pathetic experience with Samsung  .HIGHLY DISSAPPOINTED !!!!,5
"We got a defective product. This washng machine does not spin properly and as a result the clothes are still soaking wet when the cycle is done. We complained to Samsung customer service, they sent a technician who came to inspect and claimed this is how the machine is expected to work and if we want better performance we have to buy an expensive model. Overall our experience is bad and disappointing. This is disgraceful on part of samsung. We want to return the product but don't know how.",1
"Like the samsung service guy, polite and helpful.Works nicely, have another similar model from last 3 years.Top load samsung washing machines are very much reliable in long run no doubt.",5
Best Washinmachine in the market. My all family members use the same brand from long time. Even one of mechanic suggested to buy this or LG for longer life. I got installed with my known mechanic as he gave got rest Washinmachine accessories fitted by himself.,5
"I am writing this review after 3 weeks of usage and I must say it works very efficiently, clothes are very well washed without any external efforts however it takes more time  to complete cycles but overall its perfect washing machine for small  families with working women also its noise cancellation feature is worth mentioning ,a reason for adding more stars to it .😃😃😃",5
"I ordered this after seeing good reviews about it. When this got delivered I was excited but when I tried washing clothes it didn't work. It was taking water and waiting for the drum to get filled even on water level 1 mode for quick wash. After the drum got filled it started to throw water out and taking water supply. It's like a never stopping thing. After sometime it threw 4C message and drained out. It didn't even start to wash clothes. This is a new product from a reputed brand, never expected this from Samsung.",5
"Nice product. Don't install it yourself, not even open the cardboard box. You will spoil the warranty if you do that. Installation engineer reached home after one day. He was polite and checked the working condition of the machine as it was already installed by myself.",1
Good for homes where seperate water tap available but i am living in rent so everytime i need  to connect water tap to water hose to fill the water and if any time water is less machine will stop and stuck at same time so you need to refill the remaining water andPower cut is also very big problem in my area every time if power is cut machine will start from beggining and it is very annoying sometime it will take whole day to wash some cloth,1
Easy to use but make lot of noise. The washing cycle is also very short. I am not able to find a washing Cycle Mode for more than 45 Min. which is uncommon as most good brands provide longer duration for better washing.,5
"Noise is more than usual, modes to use need to improve, surf and fabric conditioner must put at a time, because no interval for fabric conditioner.  Horrible sounds while wash.  I'm not happy with the use of machine.",5
"Reviewing after 3 months of use.Black clothes always have soap on it after wash. No option to increase rinse time and with given functionality, colored clothes have detergent spots. It just takes one round of water for rinsing ao rinse functionality is biggest issue in this machine. Please do not waste your money",3
"Samsung Brand Installation service was so terrible. Installation person wasn’t able to install anything. He didn’t have a single clue. He was asking where should I plug this in? What do I do?  He didn’t have a spanner on him. No spanner no tools nothing. He told me I’d have to call a plumber to do the installation. Honestly outrageous. Terrible . I don’t recommend this product because I don’t think the warranty and other devices might be good even if the product might be. (Remains to be seen, will update).  No high hopes.",2
Ordered for first time delivered with a dent product so ordered for a replacementThe replacement was done but the the received product was even in worst condition how could a product like could be sent I don't understand,1
"Washing quality is very poor.  The drum vibrates and shakes a lot while drying.  Soap smell is present in washed cloths. It just shakes the cloth, it even does not rotate one full rotation while washing. Just OK for low budget washing machine.",1
"Simple, elegant, compact, efficient, and cost effective top loader washing machine. Had used a similar model for 9 years with no issues and this one seems to be similar to that.",1
"Every thing is good no doubt but after 2 months from purchase the draining motor will be defeated (need replacement), maximum used 5 to 8 cycle from purchase. So this product not goods for us. Issue in water level,",5
"1. Makes hell lot of noise while spinning2. Water flow inlet is super slow3. Drum shakes a lot while washing and drying.4. Cannot change wash,and spin timings manually (all machines have this basic feature)5. Overall not worth buying",1
I was using the same machine but coz it was old I sold it a week back n I bought the same new one....3rd day over... No one yet called or said anything about the installation... M standing near machine with  my soiled linen,1
"I have a Samsung Front Load and have been very happy with it. This one i ordered for my farm house. Its so good, actually better than the FL machine. I liked it so far.",3
"Is ""IMPERIAL SILVER"" silver or solid grey? If it is grey then why have you mentioned Imperial Silver as the colour? This is not a simple question of colour variance. You can not label an entire product's colour as imperial silver whereas only the control pad/membrane is of that silver shade. I view this as an intentional misrepresentation & breach of trust.",5
Using for 3 months now..perfect product. 5/5 in all categories.,1
Excellent machine. Very easy to use. No wobbling etc. as reported by others probably because the machine is placed on tiled floor in my bathroom and is perfectly balanced. Very good spin drying. I am also using LG front loading direct drive in another residence of mine and this machine performs equally well.  Pl go for it.,5
nice product I have purchased this machine in 6.5 variant but it looks very small the drum is very small doesn't look 6.5 my old LG machine was 6 kg and that was bigger than this,5
"The washing machine was installed within the last one week and the water over flowed because the valve was not working (according to the technician) of the BRAND NEW WASHING MACHINE!!! Also threads coming out of washed clothes! Terrible, won't recommend the product.",1
I am happy with the product build quality & delivery speed as promised. Installation was done on the same day by Samsung. I have been using this product past 2 weeks & overall happy with the performance.,1
Loved the product after using it . Very easy to use and does not damage clothes. Installation process was also smooth. I am mainly washing heavy clothes like curtains and bedsheets and comes out almost dry . Soak option helps to get rid of tough stains . Very happy with the purchase :),5
I ordered this washing machine after extensive research and found this was the best weight to cost ratio appliance. You will need to have a water connection within a 1 meter reach and an elevated dry space to keep it. It is pretty lightweight too so placing it on the first floor also wasn't a hassle. Overall a good buy and highly recommended.,5
I bought a washing machine and delivered as per schedule but installation not carried out as per standard time. If I called installation engineer they simply make an excuse .don't buy this washing machine,5
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I need a replacement. The machine stopped working after 3 washes.",1
"After a lot of research, I finalised this product. With amazon prime got the washing machine delivered within 24 hrs. That was super quick.The Product is good, looks brilliant, and its various features quick wash, monsoon mode are a boon for users like me. Would recommend the product,however make sure with installation process as they don't cater to your timing convenience.",1
"It an budget king washing machine for this segment, I have been using this machine for over one month I didn't face any issues in the product , But there something (or) a advice I want to share with guys don't place this machine were direct sunlight come in and hits the machine then it will make serious noise be aware of this, when the temperature is fine the machine works flawlessly",4
The best thing about this washing machine is no vibrations on spinning but it will be not so attractive if you dont make it clean outside everyday but value for money at 12k budget,5
"Pros: Gives clean wash of clothes. Less noisy compare to other washing machine of same category. Daily usage is very easy and hassle free, best part is resume function in case of power facilities during a washing cycle.Almost daily usage of this washing machine hardly put dent on electricity bills.Cons: Water inlet pipe length is small.",5
"It is taking more than given time, For a quick wash it is morethan 1.5 hour but showing 24 mins, same with the normal cycle also.Sometimes it is directly jumping to spin mode skipping rinse mode.there is no problem with water pressure.i dont think i got a genuine product.",1
Do not buy Samsung products from Amazon and also from stores.They have worst customer service and faulty products.Waste of my 💸,1
"right from the start, Amazon has been doing a good job. The item was delivered as promised in good condition and package and the service engineer visited after calling me and promptly installed it. It is working pretty well and very easy to use",5
"Ordered this in exchange of our old machine which was taken back at fair price of 1300 and the new machine is absolute value for money. Easy to use,convenient and smart to keep. Above all, unlike other brands it energy saving. Saves space and is absolutely good in quality.",4
"Likes the product a lot especially under 14k it's best option but the drum size I feel is 6 instead of 6.5kg, it should be little more spacious that's why 4 star otherwise you can go for it.",4
"Using a samsung fully automatic washing machine for the past 12 years and amazed by its reliability. So ordered another samsung as a replacement for it. It looks cute and noice level less, the control pannel is well laid and the initial reaction is"" satiafied"". Will use for sometime and update",4
"Perfect Washing Machine. Hassle free washing, user friendly product. Good sturdy body. What else you expect from a washing machine👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
"Earlier also I have been using Samsung top loading W machine, satisfied. But this model has a new feature, Eco Tub clean ,which wasts 90 minutes of valuable time & should be Deleted from software",4
"This is future, a fully automatic washing machine. Wash the clothes easily and not need any kind of manforce, just open the lid put the cloth wait for 45 mins yr cloth is clean. Its very simple. security of this washing machine is wowA highly recommended product for everyone.",5
"Good product,but during delivery need to be more concise..bez after opening the box there was a small skratch on body only bez of transportation ignorance.but the skratch was nominal that's why I don't return back...Hope the product will work well as my expectations",4
"The washing machine was ordered at sunday and received by Tuesday and by Wednesday technician came and fixed it , an additional tray was purchased for placing the washing machine . Functions are so simple that my older parents are able to operate it without any hassle . For this price an apt one . I am reviewing it after the usage for two weeks",4
Defective product it is not working at all keeps running for hours Amazon is also not accepting to return this product.Please avoid buying it from Amazon.Made 100 complaints but no resolution so far better go for other washing machine.,5
"I have been using this product daily for the last few months and till now Iam satisfactory with the product. Only drawback with this machine is that, we wont be able to manually set the water level (incase of any water shortage). Water level is automatically set by the machine.",1
"Recommended for everyday use. It does take up significantly more water. Spin dry cycle doesnt really clear out all water, it's not a big deal if you will eventually hang the clothes up to dry. Installation was easy(I was in a bind as old machine wasn't working and clothes were piling up) , I followed the instructions in the manual, and could do it myself.",5
this purchase specially for my mother and also me as well. very handy to use and less the work laod of my mother. must buy this product for 3 to 5 persons family because this in our budget and very well build quality also in this price. first thing for this purchase the product in my mind the brand of samsung because i have all the appliances at my home is samsung and used many year without no complaint.,5
Product is good and value for money. People looking for advance options may not be satisfied. Hot water and inverter technology is not available,5
"Good for one small family, at very attractive price.",5
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I just got the product will use and review further. For now product is in good condition and absolutely fine.",5
"All I can say is go for it if you are looking for a top load, great product. Did face some challenge with installation as the technician took his own sweet time to come but post that it’s been a smooth journey so far",5
Till now it is running well. Simple form of full automatic washing machine. Easy to use. It does not warm water. Good for family of 4.,5
There was a dent in the first one Amazon delivered and they sent a replacement that arrived in 2 days without too much fuss and with a convenient procedure. The machine itself is very good on all accounts.,5
"I bought this item in May 2021 but nobody has come and fix the mechine even after 15 days of delivery. And I didn’t get warranty papers also. Now washing mechine stopped working. I’ve tried to call samsung customer service many times, but the number is always busy",1
The washing machine is a great value for money.. at the time of buying it was under 14k. There is minimal noise and no vibrations. With monsoon mode the clothes dry upto 90% and need only 10 min outdoors to dry completely.The clothes comes out very well cleaned in par with the front load washing machine.,5
"I received the product yesterday and it got installed today. It is so cute to watch and simple to use. I had used semi auto twice previously and the motor broke for both of them. And this attracted me with 10 years of warranty and the reviews. Its so smart and silent than other ones. I give full stars to delivery, product and installation executive.",5
"SAMSUNG hires it's competitor Whirpool ( TVS electronics) for samsung services . The installation guy comes wearing a whirlpool Tee shirt & does not have identity card , neither wants to provide installation report on samsung installation report. Worst coordination after sales services from samsung. Be aware !",4
Never buy Samsung products.My washing machine installation kept on hold for 3 days when I refused to buy trolley from engineer for Rs 1600/- also product looks very cheap.Samsung services are now very poor and apathetic.,1
As expected of a Samsung product - good buy!,5
I waited for months before I writing this review. Thought I may find something that is not good. But this product is perfect with no issues at all. Totally worth the cost.,5
Read the reviews of a few people receiving damaged goods. Didn't expect I would be a victim too. They nicely pack the products which already have dents on them.,1
"Product is good to use and it cleans clothes very well. But the issue is with the noise. Even you balanced out the cloth around the drum, it make a loud noise while spinning.",1
"This machine is very easy to use. Just switch it on after putting in the detergent and relax. Its water efficient too. And another feature is that the machine is very slim and so requires very little space. It is noiseless, efficient and complete value for money.",5
"The product seems to be fine. But looks like the delivery caused some dents in the front part of the washing machine.Thought of putting up a replacement request, but that would have taken too long. Hence settling with this.",5
"Its really a great product and you can go for it,I got it in a deal for around 10K and its user friendly , as I bought this to my mom and even elderly people can handle easily and that is the major positive feedback about the product, it requires only little place to occupy and its overall structure is very compact, totally a great buy and product👍😃😃",3
Very efficient product. Easy to use and does not make a lot of noise. Alert music's present for every stage of the wash which reminds and tells what is happening without even looking at the machine,3
This is one of the best fully automated washing machine available in the market in this price. Samsung is one of the best brands.,5
"I already had the same machine running since 8 years at another location, bought the same again as the body and performance is really good",5
This is the second time I bought this machine. It's a good one and is recommended to others. Noise level is minimum. Easy to operate. It could be better if the machine had the stand and cover along with it.,5
"I think it’s a good machine considering the price and the brand. The machine isn’t like very silent but on a scale of 0-10 where 10 being the noisiest , I would say it’s mote like 5 also I have installed a 24 wheel stand.",5
"light weight n easy to use , Since its samsung after sales is usually good, got it installed the next day and it works good. compact also",5
"Good vfm sleek looking. But the size is not fit for washing mink blanket, single or double. The drum size should've been a bit more. Only clothes. Sometimes it played prank on me by not spinning and filling the tub till top, after I selected only spin. Somehow it got Ok by itself.",4
"The machine works exactly as you want it to.Just put your clothes in there and forget, it will do the job.Fully Automated and has an additional monsoon feature which dries clothes .However water consumption is high and a cause of concern. Company should focus on reducing water wastage.",4
I had bought this machine for my mother in law and it has been giving problems from the day we bought .The clothes are really get black whenever we use it .We have complained it multiple times and despite so many complaints nobody is bothered to take an action,1
"This is a washing machine, this machine washes clothes. We need to add water and detergent to make this work. This works without detergent too, but the washing may not be good. After washing the machine wrings the clothes. It would have been better if the machine takes out the clothes and put them on the clothes line.",5
Good Washing machine .Pathetic service from samsung. It's been a week but nobody came for installation. Need to use local plumber to install the product.,3
Dont waste your money I bought this product 3 months ago but such a waste it discharges some black substance even when the service engineers came they said they can't do anything we are now looking for an new one we wasted 15000 rs kindly don't waste your money take this as your beloved friend's advice..,1
"Easy to use, hassle free and cleans clothes nicely. Only thing is that the lint catcher doesn't do it's job much. Otherwise pretty satisfied.",5
"It's my first washing machine liked it, quality of product, medium noise levels, 95% cleaning efficiency 5% less because it can't clean dirt at collors. (Obviously they need extra attention), installation is easy and fee feature nut only useful one are available no confusion",5
Two time received damage washing machine,1
Using for few month now. It works just perfect. Installation call came next day after delivery but we already have installed it our self. Good service by Amazon and by Samsung,5
"Using it for the past 6 months, so far facing good experience. Power consumption also good. There's no star rating mentioned in the description, it's 3 star machine but the consumption is not so high. You can definitely consider on this price segment.",5
Horrible experience when I need the item urgently.,4
Not up to mark cloths are not wash clean  and stain not removed and does not have that fresh ness in cloths,4
I liked the simplicity in operation. Water consumption is normal. Cleaning is okay type. Not vey good like hand washed. Adding Ujala is a problem. Then the tub is always having some water and is not fully draining always. This may create rusting problem.,1
The machine is easy to use with about average noise as compared to my old semiautomatic machine. Clothes are clean. MONSOON FEATURE IS SAME AS RINSE NOT MUCH DIFFERENT was expecting clothes to be more dry.,1
It was mentioned that they will provide demo of washing in person under 36 hours but that never happened also one of the important part of this machine is not working and i had to replace it and I think this is not a good product not even average!,1
"Machine delivered in two days. All accessories received. Installation not undertaken as on 18 Oct 21. However, Service provider has shown installation as complete. Escalated the issue through consumer care.",3
"Silent,spacious,clean laundry comes out after washingEasy to use menu options.Budget friendlyA must buy",5
I have bought this top load washing machine from Amazon with 12 months EMI. I have noticed that noise level slightly more but rest all the functionality is great. Value for money and I recommend this product. I will review again after 6 months.,5
This is a good easy to operate machine with the right amount of features. Clothes come out clean and quite dry. No problems after even 2 months of use,4
You'll get quick washes. Easy installation and detailed demo.This is just perfect for a small family,5
It’s a very good washing machine. I am happy with the product as well as the installation which was prompt and efficient.,5
Too much Noise I call the person to clear the solutions but he is not respose my call,3
Comes with the easiest UI controls a fully automatic washer can come up with and simple to customize based on your needs. Just go for It,3
We received this machine with broken parts and this was noticed when the engineer came to install this. The engineer went away without installing. There is no option on amazon to complain about this.,5
"Very simple and easy to use, excellent budget product from Samsung. Also very energy efficient and ideal for senior citizens who doesn’t want too many controls and programs. Highly recommended.",1
Everytime machine is operated water logs under it.,5
I purchased this product 1 month back only. It run continuosly after finished spin also...again it's restarting from first...one day it's run till evening..,1
Very bad product. Brought one unit during great indian festival and received the product with number of dents. Pls don't buy it.....amazon is selling defective products using such festive offers at discounted price.,1
Product is ok not so great.Service and installation is pathetic.They took 5 days to do installation and demo.Amazon delivery was good.But samsung service is worst,2
"The product was delivered promptly, but more than three days later we haven’t even had a call about installation from Samsung. Terrible service from Samsung, and probably a sign that one shouldn’t purchase such products from Amazon.",1
Inner drum damage. Please don't buy this kind of item from Amazon. Very difficult to return. I face lot of problem now. The service also not good.,1
This is another excellent product we have got from Samsung and never be going out of expectations as always with Samsung.,1
"Never expected this from amazon to deliver a damaged product, also had to pay cash 1550 of thee exchange product as the spin is not working, the product to exchanged on priority",5
I have got it in Rs.12074.00 during republic day sale.,1
"Good for the small family for regular use,Easy operations, Medium Noise while spin.Overall Good product from Samsung",1
Its 3 star rating product.This was not mentioned in the description anywhere. Otherwise I would have considered different product with better energy saving star rating.,4
Amazon delivery system remains outstanding. It would be much better if the washing machine can atleast clean the deal stain on my t-shirt. Not at all a good cleaner. We can only use to wash away smell. I would rate 2 star only for this.,4
"Such a great washing machine. Occupying very less space, less noise, overall we are satisfied 👍",5
Product is good in condition(no damaged) and working well also but packaging Is not good (seal it from all sides it's not sealed from bottom)...,4
Till now no one come for installation and demo. Just created service request and then it is cancelled by samsung brand service. No support from Samsung band. Meaning less scheduled appointment etc. Even after 48 hrs samsung is not ready for installation and demo.,1
If you are looking  for top loading  machine  it is worth  we had front loading  now we brought  this we feel this is much better,5
Samsung is just renowned for name but in actual it is providing worst service to customer.I have purchased washing machine on Tuesday and after 8 days also no one come with intimation for installation or demo.,1
Happy with product post approx 1 month use .Price wise I am happy and doing the same work properly for the reason I bought :) . So no complaintsPackaging is superb . Thanks to seller,5
We got this machine after a thorough research but we are having a very bad experience with it as the machine keeps getting stuck and showing in balanced load. Doesn’t deserve more than two stars. Please do not buy!,2
The water is not going out of the machine. Cannot operate it.,1
Photos speak,1
Value for money product,1
"Very very nice and cute look noise less running,durable quality money valuable product thanks for amazon team and this product seller",5
Dislike about its cleaning as basic stain removing is very poor. As daily wash cleaning is below average as stain removal is very poor.. It's just rinse and spin but cleaning is very poor..,3
Good useful product and it cleans well. Have been using it for the past couple of months and there were no problems so far.  Delivery and installation was done very professionally.,3
There are two big dents on outer side.,5
This Samsung washing machine is very customer friendly and serves our requirements very well.  Our water supply n electricity supply are erratic.  We're able to use the machine against all odds.,1
Its worth the money spent. Easy to use. Cleans efficiently. I love the product. Will recommend to others as well.,5
"I purchased this WM for my father in law who was using an automatic machine for the first time. After a very detailed online lecture, he is able to run the machine on his own.",5
Kids can also operate such simple operation. Very good product.Thanks to Amazon for support and supply with huge discount.,5
Delivered a damage washing machine. Had to return it.,5
Noise level is zero. After using the product I was happy as in this rate we will not get a washing machine. It is very easy to use.,5
"Good washing, easy to use.. I bought it for 12900 under discount. Due to lockdown I had to install myself that's the demerit.",1
One of the worst product which I brought till now ... trust me you’ll regret once u buy it don’t even think it’s an option .... it makes lots of noise and worst product,1
Using the washing machine for more than a month. good product. Low nice. No vibration.installation service was good.Satisfied with the product.,5
Machine is nice but didn't work for normal spin only selection need to figure it out. Overall nice and big thanks to Amazon,5

"Reasons to go for this fridge:Smooth function,Noise less,Brand value,Good customer service,Budget friendly,Easy to use, Hassle freeModern elegant look,Energy savingIt is enough for a four to five member family",5
Wanted a fibre body machine none available in amzon.Had to go for steel one. Not happy.Otherwise the performance is good.,4
We had to shift mumbai temporary..and this washing machine is best in budget and does the operation upto satisfaction.,4
"Price seem to be 1k less today (10/04/2021) coupon + exchange amount, than what I was offered on Prime day. Very disappointing as regular benefits are better than prime and makes us rethink about prime membership",4
We just moved to a smaller city so we wanted something that was sturdy and easy to operate. We have been using it for a month or so. The washing machine is doing its job perfectly well 🙏,5
After somany reviews and  search in various shops price offered by Amazon is the best lowest price of all. A good product for day to day use. Samsung installation also went well within 24 hours.superb,5
Senses water level requirement automatically. Easy to use controls,5
It's cheaper than front load and yeah does the work of cleaning. Would recommend it to anyone.,5
Again and again issues coming. Now drain line leakage continuously. I am not satisfied with the product and washing quality,1
The product is not working as expacted. The worst washing machine I have ever purchased.,1

This is Very waste machine Please dont Buy (Samsung washing machines are not good). shiping is worstCost is very high. please dont money waste.,5
"Cost effective and performance. It's almost automatic with a minimum effort. Not many modes, but good enough for indian needs. Sales and service is ok and staff is polite. One 2 bed duvet is max you can wash in one go.",4
"Was quite confused whether to buy this machine online or not, but it went well....super product....go for it",5
"I was able to manage this by adding water manually(bucket water). I thought it needs a tap water supply. But I was able to manage with manual water filling in the machine. Through quick wash, it washes in 10 min and spins and dries clothes better. Overall, I'm glad I purchased this!",5
Dear all don't go with this brand. This is Free installation you can see in the pics. Bloody hell brand no proper installation and breaked my tap.,1
It's pretty efficient in washing clothes even with less detergent. Noise level is good too. It packs almost all essential features. The only feature that I find missing is that we can't set the washing machine to rinse clothes more than once.,1
"AWESOME!!! Adding the review after using it 3 months. Love the machine how it works ,No noiseEasy to operate6.5 Kg is enough for 4 peoples run twice a weekSmart sensors technology",5

The company person visited for installing the washing machine and while fitting the water pipe meant to be connected to the water tap has been found defective. Please arrange to replace the pipe so that we can use the product.,5
Product was good with good power saving and also low noise and easy to use.,2
